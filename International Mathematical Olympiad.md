$\bf1.$ The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminum (denoted $A$) and bronze (denoted $B$). Marianne has $n$ aluminum coins and $n$ bronze coins arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. $A$ chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer $k\le2n$, Gilberty repeatdly performs the following operation: he identifies the longest chain containing the $k^{th}$ coin from the left and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if $n=4$ and $k=4$, the process starting from the ordering $AABBBABA$ would be $AABBBABA\to{BBBAAABA}\to{AAABBBBA}\to{BBBBAAAA}\to\cdots$.

Find all pairs $(n,k)$ with $1\le{k}\le2n$ such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost $n$ coins will all be of the same type.

$\bf2.$ Let $\mathbb{R}^+$ denote the set of positive real numbers. Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}^+$ such that for each $x\in\mathbb{R}^+$, there is exactly one $y\in\mathbb{R}^+$ satisfying $$xf(y)+yf(x)\le2.$$

$\bf3.$ Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $S$ be a finite set of odd prime numbers. Prove that there is at most one way (up to rotation and reflection) to place the elements of $S$ around the circle such that the product of any two neighbors is of the form $x^2+x+k$ for some positive integer $x$.

$\bf4.$ Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon such that $BC=DE$. Assume that there is a point $T$ inside $ABCDE$ with $TB=TD,TC=TE$ and $\angle{ABT}=\angle{TEA}$. Let line $AB$ intersect lines $CD$ and $CT$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Assume that the points $P,B,A,Q$ occur on their line in that order. Let line $AE$ intersect $CD$ and $DT$ at points $R$ and $S$, respectively. Assume that the points $R,E,A,S$ occur on their line in that order. Prove that the points $P,S,Q,R$ lie on a circle.

$\bf5.$ Find all triples $(a,b,p)$ of positive integers with $p$ prime and $$a^p=b!+p.$$

$\bf6.$ Let $n$ be a positive integer. A Nordic square is an $n\times{n}$ board containing all the integers from $1$ to $n^2$ so that each cell contains exactly one number. Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers is called a valley. An uphill path is a sequence of one or more cells such that:

$\rm(i)$ the first cell in the sequence is a valley,

$\rm(ii)$ each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and

$\rm(iii)$ the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.

Find, as a function of $n$, the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square.

$\bf1.$ Let $n\ge100$ be an integer. Ivan writes the numbers $n,n+1,\dots,2n$ each on different cards. He then shuffles these $n+1$ cards, and divides them into two piles. Prove that at least one of the piles contains two cards such that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square.

$\bf2.$ Show that the inequality $$\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\sqrt{|x_i-x_j|}\le\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n\sqrt{|x_i+x_j|}$$ holds for all real numbers $x_1,\dots,x_n$.

$\bf3.$ Let $D$ be an interior point of the acute triangle $ABC$ with $AB>AC$ so that $\angle{DAB}=\angle{CAD}$. The point $E$ on the segment $AC$ satisfies $\angle{ADE}=\angle{BCD}$, the point $F$ on the segment $AB$ satisfies $\angle{FDA}=\angle{DBC}$, and the point $X$ on the line $AC$ satisfies $CX=BX$. Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the circumcenters of the triangles $ADC$ and $EXD$, respectively. Prove that the lines $BC$, $EF$ and $O_1O_2$ are concurrent.

$\bf4.$ Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with centre $I$, and $ABCD$ a convex quadrilateral such that each of the segments $AB$, $BC$, $CD$ and $DA$ is tangent to $\Gamma$. Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $AIC$. The extension of $BA$ beyond $A$ meets $\Omega$ at $X$, and the extension of $BC$ beyond $C$ meets $\Omega$ at $Z$. The extensions of $AD$ and $CD$ beyond $D$ meet $\Omega$ at $Y$ and $T$, respectively. Prove that $$AD+DT+TX+XA=CD+DY+YZ+ZC.$$

$\bf5.$ Two squirrels, Bushy and Jumpy, have collected $2021$ walnuts for the winter. Jumpy numbers the walnuts from $1$ through $2021$, and digs $2021$ little holes in a circular pattern in the ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of $2021$ moves. In the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps the positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut $k$.

Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, on the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts $a$ and $b$ such that $a<k<b$.

$\bf6.$ Let $m\ge2$ be an integer, $A$ a finite set of integers (not necessarily positive) and $B_1,B_2,\dots,B_m$ subsets of $A$. Suppose that, for every $k=1,2,\dots,m$, the sum of the elements of $B_k$ is $m^k$. Prove that $A$ contains at least $\frac{m}{2}$ elements.
