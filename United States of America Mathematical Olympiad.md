$\bf1.$ Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. The cells of an $(a+b+1)\times (a+b+1)$ grid are colored amber and bronze such that there are at least $a^2+ab-b$ amber cells and at least $b^2+ab-a$ bronze cells. Prove that it is possible to choose $a$ amber cells and $b$ bronze cells such that no two of the $a+b$ chosen cells lie in the same row or column.

$\bf2.$ Let $b\ge2$ and $w\ge2$ be fixed integers, and $n=b+w$. Given are $2b$ identical black rods and $2w$ identical white rods, each of side length $1$.

We assemble a regular $2n$-gon using these rods so that parallel sides are the same color. Then, a convex $2b$-gon $B$ is formed by translating the black rods, and a convex $2w$-gon $W$ is formed by translating the white rods. An example of one way of doing the assembly when $b=3$ and $w=2$ is shown below, as well as the resulting polygons $B$ and $W$.

Prove that the difference of the areas of $B$ and $W$ depends only on the numbers $b$ and $w$, and not on how the $2n$-gon was assembled.

$\bf3.$ Let $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ be the set of all positive real numbers. Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}_{>0}\to\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ such that for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we have $$f(x)=f(f(f(x))+y)+f(xf(y))f(x+y).$$

$\bf4.$ Find all pairs of primes $(p,q)$ for which $p-q$ and $pq-q$ are both perfect squares.

$\bf5.$ A function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is $essentially$ $increasing$ if $f(s)\le{f(t)}$ holds whenever $s\le{t}$ are real numbers such that $f(s)\ne0$ and $f(t)\ne0$.

Find the smallest integer $k$ such that for any $2022$ real numbers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{2022}$, there exist $k$ essentially increasing functions $f_1,\dots,f_k$ such that $$f_1(n)+f_2(n)+\cdots+f_k(n)=x_n~\text{for every}~n=1,2,\dots2022.$$

$\bf6.$ There are $2022$ users on a social network called Mathbook, and some of them are Mathbook-friends. (On Mathbook, friendship is always mutual and permanent.)

Starting now, Mathbook will only allow a new friendship to be formed between two users if they have at least two friends in common. What is the minimum number of friendships that must already exist so that every user could eventually become friends with every other user?

$\bf1.$ Rectangles $BCC_1B_2$, $CAA_1C_2$ and $ABB_1A_2$ are erected outside an acute triangle $ABC$. Suppose that $$\angle{BC_1C}+\angle{CA_1A}+\angle{AB_1B}=180^\circ.$$ Prove that lines $B_1C_2$, $C_1A_2$ and $A_1B_2$ are concurrent.

$\bf2.$ The Planar National Park is a subset of the Euclidean plane consisting of several trails which meet at junctions. Every trail has its two endpoints at two different junctions whereas each junction is the endpoint of exactly three trails. Trails only intersect at junctions (in particular, trails only meet at endpoints). Finally, no trails begin and end at the same two junctions. (An example of one possible layout of the park is shown to the left below, in which there are six junctions and nine trails.)

A visitor walks through the park as follows: she begins at a junction and starts walking along a trail. At the end of that first trail, she enters a junction and turns left. On the next junction she turns right, and so on, alternating left and right turns at each junction. She does this until she gets back to the junction where she started. What is the largest possible number of times she could have entered any junction during her walk, over all possible layouts of the park?

$\bf3.$ Let $n\ge2$ be an integer. An $n\times{n}$ board is initially empty. Each minute, you may perform one of three moves:

* If there is an L-shaped tromino region of three cells without stones on the board (see figure; rotations not allowed), you may place a stone in each of those cells.

* If all cells in a column have a stone, you may remove all stones from that column.

* If all cells in a row have a stone, you may remove all stones from that row.

For which $n$ is it possible that, after some non-zero number of moves, the board has no stones?

$\bf4.$ A finite set $S$ of positive integers has the property that, for each $s\in{S}$ and each positive integer divisor $d$ of $s$, there exists a unique element $t\in{S}$ satisfying $\gcd(s,t)=d$. (The elements $s$ and $t$ could be equal.)

Given this information, find all possible values for the number of elements of $S$.

$\bf5.$ Let $n\ge4$ be an integer. Find all positive real solutions to the following system of $2n$ equations:

$\begin{align}
a_{1}&=\frac{1}{a_{2n}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}},&a_{2}&=a_{1}+a_{3},\nonumber\\
a_{3}&=\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\frac{1}{a_{4}},&a_{4}&=a_{3}+a_{5},\nonumber\\
a_{5}&=\frac{1}{a_{4}}+\frac{1}{a_{6}},&a_{6}&=a_{5}+a_{7},\nonumber\\
&~~\vdots&&~~\vdots\nonumber\\
a_{2n-1}&=\frac{1}{a_{2n-2}}+\frac{1}{a_{2n}},&a_{2n}&=a_{2n-1}+a_{1}.\nonumber
\end{align}$

$\bf6.$ Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon satisfying $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{DE}$, $\overline{BC}\parallel\overline{EF}$, $\overline{CD}\parallel\overline{FA}$, and $$AB\cdot{DE}=BC\cdot{EF}=CD\cdot{FA}.$$ Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AD}$, $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{CF}$. Prove that the circumcenter of $\triangle{ACE}$, the circumcenter of $\triangle{BDF}$ and the orthocenter of $\triangle{XYZ}$ are collinear.

$\bf1.$ Let $ABC$ be a fixed acute triangle inscribed in a circle $\omega$ with center $O$. A variable point $X$ is chosen on minor arc $AB$ of $\omega$, and segments $CX$ and $AB$ meet at $D$. Denote by $O_1$ and $O_2$ the circumcenters of triangles $ADX$ and $BDX$, respectively. Determine all points $X$ for which the area of triangle $OO_1O_2$ is minimized.

$\bf2.$ An empty $2020\times2020\times2020$ cube is given, and a $2020\times2020$ grid of square unit cells is drawn on each of its six faces. A beam is a $1\times1\times2020$ rectangular prism. Several beams are placed inside the cube subject to the following conditions:

* The two $1\times1$ faces of each beam coincide with unit cells lying on opposite faces of the cube. (Hence, there are $3\cdot{2020}^2$ possible positions for a beam.)

* No two beams have intersecting interiors.

* The interiors of each of the four $1\times2020$ faces of each beam touch either a face of the cube or the interior of the face of another beam.

What is the smallest positive number of beams that can be placed to satisfy these conditions?

$\bf3.$ Let $p$ be an odd prime. An integer $x$ is called a quadratic non-residue if $p$ does not divide $x-t^2$ for any integer $t$.

Denote by $A$ the set of all integers $a$ such that $1\le{a}<p$, and both $a$ and $4-a$ are quadratic non-residues. Calculate the remainder when the product of the elements of $A$ is divided by $p$.

$\bf4.$ Suppose that $(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\dots,(a_{100},b_{100})$ are distinct ordered pairs of nonnegative integers. Let $N$ denote the number of pairs of integers $(i,j)$ satisfying $1\le{i}<j\le100$ and $\left|a_ib_j-a_jb_i\right|=1$. Determine the largest possible value of $N$ over all possible choices of the $100$ ordered pairs.

$\bf5.$ A finite set $S$ of points in the coordinate plane is called overdetermined if $|S|\ge2$ and there exists a nonzero polynomial $P(t)$, with real coefficients and of degree at most $|S|-2$, satisfying $P(x)=y$ for every point $(x,y)\in{S}$.

For each integer $n\ge2$, find the largest integer $k$ (in terms of $n$) such that there exists a set of $n$ distinct points that is not overdetermined, but has $k$ overdetermined subsets.

$\bf6.$ Let $n \ge2$ be an integer. Let $x_1\ge{x_2}\ge\cdots\ge{x_n}$ and $y_1\ge{y_2}\ge\cdots\ge{y_n}$ be $2n$ real numbers such that $$0=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n=y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n~\text{and}~1=x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2=y_1^2+y_2^2+\cdots+y_n^2.$$ Prove that $$\sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_iy_i-x_iy_{n+1-i}\right)\ge\frac{2}{\sqrt{n-1}}.$$
