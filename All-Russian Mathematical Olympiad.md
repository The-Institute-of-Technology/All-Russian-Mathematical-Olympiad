**4.** There are $18$ children in the class. Parents decided to give children from this class a cake. To do this, they first learned from each child the area of the piece he wants to get. After that, they showed a square-shaped cake, the area of which is exactly equal to the sum of $18$ named numbers. However, when they saw the cake, the children wanted their pieces to be squares too. The parents cut the cake with lines parallel to the sides of the cake (cuts do not have to start or end on the side of the cake).

When a sage enters the room, the following happens - the guard in the room chooses two arbitrary distinct numbers from the set $\{1,2,3\}$, and announces them to the sage in the room. Then the sage chooses one of those numbers, tells it to the guard, and leaves the room, and the next enters, and so on. During the game, before a sage chooses a number, he can ask the guard what were the chosen numbers of the previous two sages. During the game, the sages cannot talk to each other. At the end, when everyone has finished, the game is considered as a failure if the sum of the $100$ chosen numbers is exactly $200$; else it is successful. Prove that the sages can create a strategy, by which they can win the game.
